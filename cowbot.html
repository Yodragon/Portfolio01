				Pretty much everyone knows what a robot is, and they are generally perceived as being cold and non-human.
				So for this project, I wanted to experiment with giving a robot some character and distinction.
				I was inspired by the old cartoons of the early 2000s which featured lots of Wild West-themed material.
				I really wanted my robot to look like it was pulled from one of those cartoons while also having a personality of its own.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of aesthetics, I also wanted the robot to maintain that cartoonish visual style as well.
				It uses lots of simple shapes like rectangles and circles, and a strong silhouette.
				I also experimented with giving it a white outline to mimic the aesthetic of a character sticker.
