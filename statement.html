					<p class="align-center">
						For much of my life, art had manifested itself in the physical world as pencil drawings on paper with the occasional crayon colorings.<br>
						It wasn’t until I reached middle school that a teacher enraptured by new tech had introduced me to the world of digital art creation.<br>
						And now what was once tangible became intangible, the art finding life in a new world separate from ours.<br>
						Just like that middle school teacher, I too was entranced by the new possibilities that this digital realm promised.<br>
						And I have remained in that realm ever since.
