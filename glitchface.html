				For this work, I wanted to try my hand at glitch art for the first time.
				I settled on the idea of making this twisted, cyclopian version of myself.
				Eyes are often associated with the darker aspects of the internet, the feeling of your movements being watched in this digital space.
				In a way, I am making myself out to be an overseer of sorts here.
			</p>
			<p>
				The glitch effects were created by messing around with the code that makes up a jpeg.
				I had to make a lot of iterations of these glitched images to create this gif.
				The multicolored image that you see most of the time is a combination of different iterations that were overlayed using blending modes.
				I wasn't planning on having the image blink at first, but I felt that I needed it to blink at least once for the creep factor.
