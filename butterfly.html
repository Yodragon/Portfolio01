				For this video project, I really wanted to make an exploration-style kind of video that focused on a place I spend a lot of time in on campus.
				The Duncan Hall science building is where I often go while waiting for biology class to start.
				I like to roam around and take in all of the fascinatingly scientific scenery, like the animals behind glass or the somewhat terrifying stairwells.
				There's that feeling you get when you just let your legs wander and you just take everything in, and I feel my video captures that rather well.

				I was inspired by urban exploration videos that I like to watch every now and then.
				Urban exploration is the act of exploring and filming an abandoned urban area, like abandoned buildings or mineshafts.
				And while this building isn't abandoned, I still kind of wanted to capture the same feeling of exploring a place like that.
				I definitely intentionally avoided having footage of other people roaming the halls which helps create that feeling of isolation here.
