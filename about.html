					<h2 class="align-center">About Me</h2>
					<p></p>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						My name is Daniel Songer. I am currently a digital media artist practicing my work at San Jose State University.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						For much of my life, art had manifested itself in the physical world as pencil drawings on paper with the occasional splashes of color added for extra effect.
						It wasn’t until I reached middle school that a teacher enraptured by new tech had introduced me to the world of digital art creation.
						And very quickly, I was taken away by the tools he shared with me.
						Just like that middle school teacher, I too was entranced by the new possibilities that this digital realm promised.
						And I have remained in that realm ever since, transitioning my workflow from the pen and paper to the tablet and desktop.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						And now what was once tangible became intangible, the art finding life in a new digital world separate from our physical one.
						It is this new world where math and code became art.
						But in the end, it’s not just about the math or the tech behind digital works.
						It’s about what you make of it, and this is what I made.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						I am interested in both horror and cuteness which allows me to have a great range of subjects to explore.
						On this site, I have compiled the works that best capture the range of subjects I've explored.
						Whether it be a jovial view into a space kitty adventure, or something darker like the broken visage of a single-eyed terror.
						All of these are great to have for this digital space of mine.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						But although I consider myself primarily a digital artist now, that by no means makes me a master at the craft.
						Rather, there is still much for me to learn and specialize in.
						At the moment, my knowledge is spread too thin throughout the different forms of digital media and I would love to dedicate my efforts to a single expression of digital art creation.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						So my goal for the immediate future is to find the one or two forms of digital media that I can specialize in and create a career out of.
						So far I am leaning towards video editing or illustration.
						Although, the realm of coding is not completely out of reach either considering my ability to work with Github and html to create my portfolio website.
					</h5>
					<h5 class="align-left">
						Whatever the path I choose, I know that my place is here in the digital world and I cannot wait to see what avenues I end up taking.
