				I have always had a love-hate relationship with ducks.
				They used to infest my swimming pool in my backyard, being somewhat of a nuisance.
				But nowadays they never show up, and they mainly hang around the newly constructed water features around my area like the park water fountain you see in this video.
				And to be honest, things feel a little lonely without those waterfowl around.
				In a way, this video sort of captures that feeling I have towards ducks, both the good and the bad.

				I also took a lot of inspiration from horror films in this project, using things like spooky atmospheric sounds and even tiny jumpscares.
				I made this video during October, so it felt appropriate to play into those scary Halloween vibes.
				All of the sound effects in this video were recorded and put together by me, whether they be active water faucets or my creaking bedroom door.
				During a camping trip in elementary school, I was taught how to make duck calls so the beginning of the video actually features some of those calls from me.
