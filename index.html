							<h2>Twinkle in His Eye</h2>
							<h3>I wanted to test out creating a simple GIF animation using Photoshop.<br>
							Since GIFs have limited color ranges, I thought about playing around with that in mind.<br>
							So not just strong colors in key areas of the image, but also the lack of color as well.<br>
							I chose to feature a corgi since I used to have one, and I just thought that bowtie contrasted really well with the eyes.</h3>
							<p>Program: Adobe Photoshop</p>

							<h2>Space Kitty Sandwich</h2>
							<h3>For this piece, I wanted to practice my photo manipulation skills.<br>
							It was fun to combine cartoon-like elements with realistic elements.<br>
							As a cat owner, I often see cat loafs so a sandwich fits the bill perfectly.<br>
							There's also nothing more fun than adventures in space with rainbows and sparkles of course.</h3>

							<h2>Bass in Black</h2>
							<h3>This is a tribute to one of the most influential graphic designers in Hollywood history, Saul Bass.<br>
							I wanted to play around with geometry and jagged linework in this illustration to sort of mimic the style he is known for.<br>
							I was also inspired by old spy movie posters, emphasizing a strong black and white figure contrasted by a sharp red background.</h3>

							<h2>Rootin' Tootin' Cowbot 9000</h2>
							<h3>Pretty much everyone knows what a robot is, so I wanted to experiment with giving a robot some character and distinction.<br>
							I was inspired by the old cartoons of the early 2000s which featured lots of Wild West-themed material.<br>
							The aesthetic of the robot is also very cartoonish, using simple shapes and geometry to fit the style.</h3>

							<h2>Feeling Blue</h2>
							<h3>Usually feeling blue is associated with sadness, but I wanted to explore a more happy iteration in this self portrait.<br>
							Unlike my portrait of Saul Bass, I wanted to focus on using organic shapes and roundness to represent myself rather than sharp geometry.<br>
							And if you're wondering, yes my favorite color is indeed blue.</h3>

							<h2>Cyclopian Immanence</h2>
							<h3>For this work, I wanted to try my hand at glitch art for the first time.<br>
							I settled on the idea of making this twisted, cyclopian version of myself.<br>
							The glitch effects were created by messing around with the code that makes up a jpeg.
							I had to make a lot of iterations of these glitched images to create this gif.<br>
							The multicolored image that you see most of the time is a combination of different iterations that were overlayed using blending modes.</h3>

							<h2>Feathered Dragon</h2>
							<h3>Speculative biology is a subject of great interest to me, having to do with the potential forms life might take in the future or on other worlds.<br>
							For this piece, I wanted to take one of my favorite animals, a komodo dragon, and give it these avian characteristics.<br>
							It is now covered in a layer of red plumage, with wings beside its arms, and a feathery mane adorning its head and tail.<br>
							The environment uses photos of the Tiangxi mountains but are colored greenish blue to contrast the red of the animal.<br>
							This piece also gave me the opportunity to work in a much more realistic style than the more stylized work I usually do.</h3>

							<h2>Provis Flora</h2>
							<h3>This is another glitch artwork that I was experimenting with.<br>
							I was walking around my neighborhood and spotted this single flower arising out of a patch of white rocks.<br>
							It felt like the perfect subject for a glitch piece, an organic subject being the antithesis of a digital medium.<br>
							I know some people are annoyed by the Hulk purple/green color combo, but I felt it worked rather well here.<br>
							The green really helps the flowering plant stand out against that unnatural purple.</h3>

							<h2>I Spy a Butterfly in the Halls of Science</h2>
							<h3>For this video project, I really wanted to make an exploration-style kind of video that focused on a place I spend a lot of time in on campus.<br>
							The Duncan Hall science building is where I often go while waiting for biology class to start, roaming around and taking in all of the fascinatingly scientific scenery.<br>
							I was inspired by urban exploration videos I've seen, and while this building isn't abandoned, I still kind of wanted to capture the same feelings.<br>
							There's that feeling you get when you just let your legs wander while your mind merely looks out and gazes.</h3>

							<h2>Anas Mortis</h2>
							<h3>I have always had a love-hate relationship with ducks.<br>
							They used to infest my swimming pool, but with the construction of that park water feature that you see in the video, they've since moved there instead and now things feel a little lonely without them.<br>
							In a way, this video sort of captures that feeling I have towards duck. It showcases their life but also their death.<br>
							I also took a lot of inspiration from horror films in this project, using things like spooky atmospheric sounds and even tiny jumpscares.</h3>
